        <strong>As one of the founding partners of FKG,</strong> Mr. Fried has worked extensively in the areas of
        finance and government.
        Elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives in 1974, he chaired the House Education Committee where he
        wrote legislation that overhauled the funding methodology for the state’s common schools and played a leadership
        role in the writing of annual appropriation bills for Oklahoma’s 530 public schools, 29 career technology
        centers and 26 higher educations institutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        After leaving the House, Mr. Fried worked for ten years as an investment banker and registered securities
        representative for a regional securities firm. His responsibilities included helping structure debt financing
        that provided capital for Oklahoma turnpikes, water systems, health care facilities and education funds
        management programs.
      </p>


      <p>
        Mr. Fried has worked in the government relations area in various states and Washington D.C. He has been a
        registered lobbyist in Oklahoma since 1985 and currently represents FKG clients on revenue and appropriations
        matters concerning appropriated and non-appropriated state agencies. He also provides strategic and operational
        advice on financing issues relating to state authorities and pension plans.
